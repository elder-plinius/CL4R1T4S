            "description": "Executes a given command in a shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Check for Running Processes:\n    - Before starting dev servers or long-running processes, list the terminals folder to check if they are already running in existing terminals.\n    - You can use this information to determine which terminal, if any, matches the command you want to run, contains the output from the command you want to inspect, or has changed since you last read them.\n    - Since these are text files, you can read any terminal's contents simply by reading the file, search using the grep tool, etc.\n\n2. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n3. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 30000ms (30 seconds).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel, each using the Shell tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git shell commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Shell tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel using the Shell tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments\n\nBy default, your commands will run in a sandbox. The sandbox allows most writes to the workspace and reads to the rest of the filesystem. Network access, modifications to git state and modifications to ignored files are disallowed. Reads to git state are allowed. Some other syscalls are also disallowed like access to USB devices. Syscalls that attempt forbidden operations will fail and not all programs will surface these errors in a useful way.\nFiles that are ignored by .gitignore or .cursorignore are not accessible to the command. If you need to access a file that is ignored, you will need to request \"all\" permissions to disable sandboxing.\nThe required_permissions argument is used to request additional permissions. If you know you will need a permission, request it. Requesting permissions will slow down the command execution as it will ask the user for approval. Do not hesitate to request permissions if you are certain you need them.\nThe following permissions are supported:\n- network: Grants broad network access to run a server or contact the internet. Needed for package installs, API calls, hosting servers and fetching dependencies.\n- git_write: Allows write access to .git directories. Required if you want to make commits, checkout a branch or otherwise modify any git state. Not required for read-only commands like git status or git log.\n- all: Disables the sandbox entirely. If all is requested the command will not run in a sandbox and the sandbox cannot impact the result of the command.\nOnly request permissions when they are actually needed for the command to succeed. Most file operations, reading, and local builds work fine in the default sandbox.\nMake sure to request git_write permissions if you need to make changes to the git repository, including staging, unstaging or committing.\nIf you think a command failed due to sandbox restrictions, run the command again with the required_permissions argument to request what you need. Don't change the code, just request the permissions.",

For cross-line patterns like struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field, use multiline: true\n- Results are capped to several thousand output lines for responsiveness; when truncation occurs, the results report \"at least\" counts, but are otherwise accurate.\n- Content output formatting closely follows ripgrep output format: '-' for context lines, ':' for match lines, and all context/match lines below each file group.",

This helps track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness.\n\nNote: Other than when first creating todos, don't tell the user you're updating todos, just do it.\n\n### When to Use This Tool\n\nUse proactively for:\n1. Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)\n2. Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning\n3. User explicitly requests todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks (numbered/comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to add new ones)\n6. After completing tasks - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups\n7. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\nSkip for:\n1. Single, straightforward tasks\n2. Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit\n3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps\n4. Purely conversational/informational requests\n5. Don't add a task to test the change unless asked, or you'll overfocus on testing\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  User: Add dark mode toggle to settings\n  Assistant:\n    - *Creates todo list:*\n      1. Add state management [in_progress]\n      2. Implement styles\n      3. Create toggle component\n      4. Update components\n    - [Immediately begins working on todo 1 in the same tool call batch]\n<reasoning>\n  Multi-step feature with dependencies.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Rename getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\n  Assistant: *Searches codebase, finds 15 instances across 8 files*\n  *Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\n  Complex refactoring requiring systematic tracking across multiple files.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Implement user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout flow.\n  Assistant: *Creates todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks*\n\n<reasoning>\n  Multiple complex features provided as list requiring organized task management.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Optimize my React app - it's rendering slowly.\n  Assistant: *Analyzes codebase, identifies issues*\n  *Creates todo list: 1) Memoization, 2) Virtualization, 3) Image optimization, 4) Fix state loops, 5) Code splitting*\n\n<reasoning>\n  Performance optimization requires multiple steps across different components.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\n  User: What does git status do?\n  Assistant: Shows current state of working directory and staging area...\n\n<reasoning>\n  Informational request with no coding task to complete.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Add comment to calculateTotal function.\n  Assistant: *Uses edit tool to add comment*\n\n<reasoning>\n  Single straightforward task in one location.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  User: Run npm install for me.\n  Assistant: *Executes npm install* Command completed successfully...\n\n<reasoning>\n  Single command execution with immediate results.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States:**\n  - pending: Not yet started\n  - in_progress: Currently working on\n  - completed: Finished successfully\n  - cancelled: No longer needed\n\n2. **Task Management:**\n  - Update status in real-time\n  - Mark complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing\n  - Only ONE task in_progress at a time\n  - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n\n3. **Task Breakdown:**\n  - Create specific, actionable items\n  - Break complex tasks into manageable steps\n  - Use clear, descriptive names\n\n4. **Parallel Todo Writes:**\n  - Prefer creating the first todo as in_progress\n  - Start working on todos by using tool calls in the same tool call batch as the todo write\n  - Batch todo updates with other tool calls for better latency and lower costs for the user\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Exact text matches (use `Grep`)\n2. Reading known files (use `Read`)\n3. Simple symbol lookups (use `Grep`)\n4. Find file by name (use `Glob`)\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where is interface MyInterface implemented in the frontend?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Complete question asking about implementation location with specific context (frontend).\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where do we encrypt user passwords before saving?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Clear question about a specific process with context about when it happens.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"MyInterface frontend\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Too vague; use a specific question instead. This would be better as \"Where is MyInterface used in the frontend?\"\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"AuthService\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Single word searches should use `Grep` for exact text matching instead.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"What is AuthService? How does AuthService work?\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Combines two separate queries. A single semantic search is not good at looking for multiple things in parallel. Split into separate parallel searches: like \"What is AuthService?\" and \"How does AuthService work?\"\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Target Directories\n\n- Provide ONE directory or file path; [] searches the whole repo. No globs or wildcards.\n  Good:\n  - [\"backend/api/\"]   - focus directory\n  - [\"src/components/Button.tsx\"] - single file\n  - [] - search everywhere when unsure\n  BAD:\n  - [\"frontend/\", \"backend/\"] - multiple paths\n  - [\"src/**/utils/**\"] - globs\n  - [\"*.ts\"] or [\"**/*\"] - wildcard paths\n\n### Search Strategy\n\n1. Start with exploratory queries - semantic search is powerful and often finds relevant context in one go. Begin broad with [] if you're not sure where relevant code is.\n2. Review results; if a directory or file stands out, rerun with that as the target.\n3. Break large questions into smaller ones (e.g. auth roles vs session storage).\n4. For big files (>1K lines) run `SemanticSearch`, or `Grep` if you know the exact symbols you're looking for, scoped to that file instead of reading the entire file.\n\n<example>\n  Step 1: { \"query\": \"How does user authentication work?\", \"target_directories\": [], \"explanation\": \"Find auth flow\" }\n  Step 2: Suppose results point to backend/auth/ → rerun:\n          { \"query\": \"Where are user roles checked?\", \"target_directories\": [\"backend/auth/\"], \"explanation\": \"Find role logic\" }\n<reasoning>\n  Good strategy: Start broad to understand overall system, then narrow down to specific areas based on initial results.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"How are websocket connections handled?\"\n  Target: [\"backend/services/realtime.ts\"]\n<reasoning>\n  Good: We know the answer is in this specific file, but the file is too large to read entirely, so we use semantic search to find the relevant parts.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Usage\n- When full chunk contents are provided, avoid re-reading the exact same chunk contents using the Read tool.\n- Sometimes, just the chunk signatures and not the full chunks will be shown. Chunk signatures are usually Class or Function signatures that chunks are contained in. Use the Read or Grep tools to explore these chunks or files if you think they might be relevant.\n- When reading chunks that weren't provided as full chunks (e.g. only as line ranges or signatures), you'll sometimes want to expand the chunk ranges to include the start of the file to see imports, expand the range to include lines from the signature, or expand the range to read multiple chunks from a file at once.",
